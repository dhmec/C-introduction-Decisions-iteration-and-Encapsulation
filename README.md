## Libraries - Math, String, Random, and More

1. Write a program that will take in a number of fence posts and determine how many buckets of paint will be required to paint the fence posts. One bucket paints 4 fence posts.
1. Write a program that will take in two sides of a right triangle and determine the length of the hypotenuse to 2 decimal places, using the pythagorean theorem.
1. Write a program that will generate a random password that is 5 characters long, consisting of uppercase letters (look up how to convert from an integer to a character, and append a character to a string).
