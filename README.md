## Procedural Programing / Simple sequence

1. Write a program that prompts the user for a number (as an int) and outputs the cube of that number (raised to the third power).
1. Write a program that will take in a total dollar value (as a double) and a number of diners (as an int) and calculate the amount of the bill that each diner should pay (equal split).
1. Write a program that will take in a user’s age and calculate their birth year (assuming this year’s birthday has passed).
1. Write a program that will take in a 4 digit integer and calculate the sum of its digits without ever converting the integer to a string.

## Libraries - Math, String, Random, and More
1. Write a program that will take in a string, convert it to uppercase, and output it.
1. Write a program that will take in three integers, and determine the highest and lowest of the three.
1. Write a program that will take in a number of fence posts and determine how many buckets of paint will be required to paint the fence posts. One bucket paints 4 fence posts.
1. Write a program that will take in two sides of a right triangle and determine the length of the hypotenuse to 2 decimal places, using the pythagorean theorem.
1. Write a program that will generate a random password that is 5 characters long, consisting of uppercase letters (look up how to convert from an integer to a character, and append a character to a string).

## Expressions and Decisions
1. Write a program that will generate a random number between 1 and 10, prompt two users for a guess, and output the winner (closest to the number). If both guesses are equidistant from the target or both players guess the same number, it is a draw.
1. Write a program that will take in an integer from the user and display whether it is odd or even.
1. Write a program that will determine whether a number entered by the user is a perfect square of a whole number or not.
1. Write a program that will take in an operator (such as + or *) and two operands (as ints), and output the result. Ensure division produces accurate results.
1. Write a program that will take in a 3 character month code (case insensitive) and output the full name of that month and the number of days in that month, using a switch. Only prompt for the year if the code for February is entered.
